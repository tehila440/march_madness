March Madness is the NCAA (men's and women') Division I basketball national championship tournaments that begin in March.
There are thousands of games that lead up to the tournament season and therefore, many features to explore.

The exploratory analytics with March Madness dataset found [here](Exploratory analytics with March Madness dataset).  
The purpose of this notebook was exploratory data analysis of the 'Madness' in March Madness. 

There is a large amount of historical data dating back many years beginning in 1985 for some of the datasets. 
I compiled information from multiple datasets to explore various aspects of March Madness.  I explored both tournament
data regular season data and focused on 'cinderella' teams.  Cinderella teams are the higher ranked seeds that 
make it up to the National Championship.  They are the 'underdogs'.  Every season there is a least one underdog  that make it to 
final four.
